                <h1>An ode to mapo tofu</h1>
                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>There are countless Chinese restaurants in Singapore, and I feel confident in declaring that I've had my fair share of mapo tofu (also known as: mapo doufu; 麻婆豆腐). It's a staple of many menus, not necessarily Sichuan ones. Your friendly neighbourhood zichar stall might even serve it, albeit a heavily <strong>bastardised</strong> version thick with corn starch.</p>

                    "Eugene Wu, the Librarian of the Harvard Yenching Library, grew up in Chengdu and claims that as a schoolboy he used to eat Pock-Marked Ma's Bean Curd or mapo doufu, at a restaurant run by the original Pock-Marked Ma herself. One ordered by weight, specifying how many grams of bean curd and meat, and the serving would be weighed out and cooked as the diner watched. It arrived at the table fresh, fragrant, and so spicy hot, or la, that it actually caused sweat to break out."

                <h2>Recreating the recipe</h2>
                <p>As is the case with many Chinese recipes, precise measurements are thrown out the door when it comes to mapo tofu. A few ingredients, however, frequently make an appearance.</p>
